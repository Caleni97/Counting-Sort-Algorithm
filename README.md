# Counting-Sort-Algorithm
If the values in a list to be sorted vary in range from 100 000 to 110 000, making use of a  frequency array with 110 001 entries will not be efficient. Make use of the Countingsort  algorithm implemented as Act1 during engagement with the self-study materials and  modify it to efficiently cater for a range of values where the minimum value is not 0.
